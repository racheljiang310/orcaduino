# ORCAduino
---
Orca is a two-dimensional, live-coding esoteric language that executes program instructions that are on a grid. It is actively maintained by the Hundred Rabbits collective group. Operators are represented by capital letters while lowercase and digit characters represent its Base36 values. Orca has many versions, supported on both uxn, browser, and command-line. The purpose of this project is to explore the visual side of ORCA, rather than its well-known audio-synthesizing features created via the MIDI operator. We'll go over implementation architecture, as well as test programs to visualize the beautiful language that is ORCAduino
